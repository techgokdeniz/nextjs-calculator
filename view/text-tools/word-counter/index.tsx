Itâ€™s an essential feature in many word processing programs and is also available as standalone online tools.

        "A word counter works by scanning the text inputted into the tool and counting the number of words based on spaces and punctuation marks that separate each word. In more advanced tools, it can also count characters, paragraphs, and even estimate reading time. Most word counters are integrated into text editors like Microsoft Word or Google Docs, providing a real-time word count as you type. Online versions require you to paste your text into a designated field, and the word count is instantly displayed.",
